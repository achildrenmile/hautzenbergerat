This whole website does not use a traditional CMS. It is 100% statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
Hugo is a static site generator, which allows me to write new pages as simple and portable Markdown files and then generate the whole website as based on the template I wrote for this.

## No JavaScript, no cookies, no tracking
As you might hvae noticed, this website does not set any cookies, it does not have any social media share buttons or integrations, there is not even a single line fo JavaScript.
There are several reasons for that. First I wanted it to be fast, therefor I used a static site generator, which means there is no need for dynamically loading content. This website is about its content, so why should I use a fancy animated template, that has no purpose, but makes reading harder.
Another reason for not using share buttons is, that besides making the site slower, they also would require you to opt-in.
There is no tracking or analytics on this page, because I don't need it. This is my private website. I do not have any financial interesst in this and I am not dependend on clicks and views. If you like what you see here, come back to see what's new from time to time.

## Sharing is caring
If you like the content you see here, feel free to copy the URL into any spcial media page or messemger you want to share it with your friends. Actually I would be very happy about this.

## Open
This whole website, incl. templates and the hugo site, is available at [Github](https://github.com/salendron/hautzenbergerat). Feel free to take alook at it and maybe use my template. I use git here, because it allows me to track changes and makes it easy for me to write from wherever I want.
