This project is all about concrete blocks to live or work in. It's about colors, light, shadow and geometry.

## Old and New

As I walk through cities I always have this feeling of chaos. Buildings that were build or changed since the day the city was founded. Different eras, different time, different styles, build as close to each other as possible to not waste a single inch of ground.

## Unfinished

This album is one that will grow over time, because I think I will find more blocks that need to be added to here. So you should come back here from time to time to see if there is something new to look at.
