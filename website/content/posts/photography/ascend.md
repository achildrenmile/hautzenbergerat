I am not a good climber. Not at all. I'm a beginner at best. Nevertheless I love doing it. This album was shot during an outdoor climbing session with friends on a single roll of Kodak T-Max 400.

## Raw Size

I think why this black and white film worked so well, was because the contrast plays nicely with the scale and hight I wanted to capture. Also the sunlight creating a white sky and deep black shadows made everything look more dramatic.
